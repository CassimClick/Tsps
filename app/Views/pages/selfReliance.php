                    <strong>Self reliance</strong> education in schools as advocated by the late father of the nation
                    Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere is almost dying a natural death in most schools. On realizing this problem
                    Trust St. Patrick Schools established a school farm, located within 1.5 kilometers north of the
                    school compound just opposite Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Olosiva. This move is in line
                    with the compliance to self reliance in schools. Our school farm is more than a traditional farm. It
                    has an added advantage of having a greenhouse. Trust St. Patrick Schools' students and pupils are
                    exposed to greenhouse farming technology.

                    learning how to make effective use of farmland. They cultivate diverse crops such as vegetables,
                    maize, beans, including highly-priced crops like capsicum, lettuce, cucumber, which are among major
                    cash crops. The farm also has two ﬁsh ponds - which measure 15 by 30 meters - each of which can
                    accommodate more than 4000 ﬁsh that are able to mature within 7 months. The advantage of greenhouse
                    farming over traditional farming is that in a greenhouse one can have crops all year round. And
                    obviously, when you harvest your crops out of season they are likely to command high prices.

                    Needless to say, an investment in establishing a school farm can result in a signiﬁcant saving in
                    the food budget, besides students beneﬁtting from self reliance education As part of the
                    celebrations of the 20th Anniversary of the school, we are happy to open the greenhouse to
                    neighbors, parents and the general public. We invite our neighbors to take full advantage of the
                    school farm by buying some of their daily supplies from there. We urge parents to enroll their
                    children with Trust St. Patrick Schools because they won't regret it.
