                <p>
                    Primary School is an intermediate level of the basic education in Tanzania. As a bridge to the
                    higher education at these ages, TSPS students are groomed to solve problems in different ways,
                    define terminologies, understand before they compare and contrast. At this level they are also
                    enabled to evaluate, apply and judge matters based on facts of their findings. Generally the
                    subjects taught are designed to develop students's logical thinking, good understanding and
                    creativity within the world we live in.
                    The Primary education is for the students of the ages between 5 to 12.
