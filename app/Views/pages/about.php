                <p>
                    Despite its excellent track records academically, TSPS decided not to be pleased by the positions
                    acquired in various interschools tests, mock and national examinations which are normally a day’s
                    work or two but rather take further steps to strengthen student’s individual potentials and talents
                    through daily continuous assessments academically and socially. Kindly note that all Primary 7
                    finalists pass their national examinations and get selected to join government schools including the
                    famous special schools.
